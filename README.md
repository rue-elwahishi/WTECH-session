Project Collaboration Guidelines 
 Welcome to our project! To maintain a clean, efficient, and effective workflow, we've established a set of guidelines for naming branches, committing changes, pushing updates, and creating pull requests. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for collaboration and ensuring our project's success.

1. Branch Naming Conventions
Our branch names should be descriptive, reflecting the feature or fix they're intended to address, and structured as follows:
- Feature Branches: feature/<short-feature-description>
- Bugfix Branches: bugfix/<short-bug-description>
- Hotfix Branches: hotfix/<short-hotfix-description>
- Refactoring Branches: refactor/<short-refactor-description>

Examples:
- 'feature/login-authentication'
- 'bugfix/login-error-handling'
- 'hotfix/critical-security-patch'
- 'refactor/improve-login-performance'

2. Committing Changes
When committing changes, aim for clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose and context of your changes. A good commit message consists of a title/subject and a detailed body if necessary. Follow this structure:

- Title: Summarize the change in around 50 characters or less.
- Body: Provide a detailed description of the change. Explain what changed, why it was changed, and any other relevant details.
Example: 
``` Fix login redirection bug

- Ensure users are redirected to the homepage after successful login.
- Resolves an issue where users were mistakenly redirected to a 404 page.
```
3. Pushing Changes
Before pushing changes, make sure to pull the latest updates from the main branch and resolve any conflicts locally. To push your changes:
  1. Navigate to your branch: git checkout <branch-name>
  2. Pull the latest updates: git pull origin main
  3. Push your changes: git push origin <branch-name>
